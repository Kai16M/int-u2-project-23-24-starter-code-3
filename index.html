    <p>Bullying is the use of force, coercion, hurtful teasing or threat, to abuse, aggressively dominate or intimidate.
      The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception of an imbalance of
      physical or social power. This imbalance distinguishes bullying from conflict. Bullying is a subcategory of
      aggressive behavior characterized by hostile intent, imbalance of power and repetition over a period of time.</p>
